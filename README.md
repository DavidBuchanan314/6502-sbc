# 6502
Documentation and code for my 6502 SBC.

After a few months of not working on this project, I realised that I had completely forgotten how it worked. The main purpose of this repo is to reverse-engineer the project, and produce documentation.

The project was inspired by Grant Searle's [minimal chip count 6502 computer](http://searle.x10host.com/6502/Simple6502.html).
